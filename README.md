# imageprocessing_fishinggame
 his project utilizes the OpenCV library to automate interactions with a fishing mini-game. The software captures the game screen and identifies the fish, subsequently performing automatic mouse clicks to target them. Fish detection is achieved by processing the captured image through specific filters, followed by pattern matching using a defined threshold value (HSV filter and thresholding). In cases where the names of the desired fish do not appear on the screen, the mini-game is automatically terminated using keyboard inputs to prevent time loss. This functionality is implemented using image processing techniques in conjunction with the keyboard library.
